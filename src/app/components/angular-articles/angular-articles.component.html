            <p>Optimization techniques are crucial for enhancing the performance and efficiency of Angular applications. Below are ten optimization techniques:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Lazy Loading:</strong> Lazy loading is a technique that loads only the required modules and their associated components when navigating to a specific route. This helps reduce the initial bundle size and improves loading times.</li>
                <li><strong>Tree Shaking:</strong> Tree shaking is a process of eliminating dead code or unused modules from the final bundle. By removing unnecessary code, tree shaking reduces the bundle size and improves application performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Minification:</strong> Minification is the process of reducing the size of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML files by removing unnecessary characters such as white spaces, comments, and line breaks. Smaller file sizes result in faster downloads and improved loading times.</li>
                <li><strong>OnPush Change Detection:</strong> Using the OnPush change detection strategy in Angular components helps optimize change detection by triggering it only when the component's input properties change or when events are emitted. This reduces unnecessary change detection cycles and improves application performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Optimized Asset Loading:</strong> Optimizing asset loading involves techniques such as bundling assets, using content delivery networks (CDNs), and leveraging browser caching. These optimizations reduce the time it takes to load assets such as images, fonts, and stylesheets, resulting in faster page rendering.</li>
                <li><strong>Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compilation:</strong> AOT compilation converts Angular HTML and TypeScript code into efficient JavaScript code during the build process. This reduces runtime compilation overhead and improves startup performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Code Splitting:</strong> Code splitting involves breaking down the application code into smaller chunks and loading them asynchronously. This allows for faster initial page loads and improves resource utilization.</li>
                <li><strong>Service Worker and Progressive Web App (PWA) Support:</strong> Implementing service workers and building Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) enable features like offline support, background syncing, and caching, which can significantly improve the user experience, especially on slower networks.</li>
                <li><strong>Bundle Optimization:</strong> Techniques such as code minification, compression, and dead code elimination can further optimize the size of JavaScript bundles, reducing load times and improving overall performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Optimizing Angular Modules:</strong> Organizing Angular modules efficiently, avoiding circular dependencies, and lazy loading modules where appropriate can streamline the application architecture and improve performance.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>By implementing these optimization techniques, Angular developers can create high-performing and efficient applications that deliver a superior user experience.</p>

            <h2 [ngClass]="{ 'active-topic': activeTopicId === 'viewchild-contentchild' }">ViewChild, ContentChild, ViewChildren, ContentChildren</h2>
            <p>These decorators let you access child components, directives, or DOM elements from a parent component, either in the view or projected content. They are essential for advanced component communication, dynamic content manipulation, and building reusable UI patterns.</p>

            <h2 [ngClass]="{ 'active-topic': activeTopicId === 'route-reuse-strategy' }">Route Reuse Strategy</h2>
            <p>Route Reuse Strategy allows you to control when Angular reuses or destroys route components, enabling caching and improved navigation performance. Custom strategies can be implemented to preserve component state, speed up navigation, and provide a smoother user experience.</p>

            <p>Angular Security covers best practices and built-in tools (like DomSanitizer) to protect your app from XSS, CSRF, and other web vulnerabilities. It is important to sanitize user input, use Angular's security APIs, and follow secure coding practices to keep your application safe.</p>

            <p>Accessibility (a11y) ensures your Angular app is usable by everyone, including people with disabilities, using ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and best practices. Building accessible apps is not only a legal requirement in many regions but also improves usability for all users.</p>
